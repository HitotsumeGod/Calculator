Reasonable TI-34 based terminal calculator capable of taking arbitrarily long mathematic expressions as input and producing an accurate floating-point result.

The key feature of this program is its parsing ability: unlike most basic calculators, which require operands and operators (which are themselves often limited in their number) to be passed in stages,
wherein each component of a given expression will be accepted by the program and type-identified through necessity (the program will only accept input of a given type during a certain stage).
This method, while acceptable for truly entry-level programming, is utterly unreasonable and unattractive to any laymen seeking an effective and familiar tool of mathematical calculation. 
This calculator, however, is capable of flawlessly mimicking the behavior of traditional TI-34 educational calculators, which allow a user to input an arbitrarily long or complex expression to be calculated.
This approach is not only much more familiar to anyone who has been through the U.S. public school system, but is furthermore a far more elegant, encapsulated, and adaptable framework for parsing user-input mathematical
expressions, and will thus be useful not only as a simple and efficient tool for its intended use, but also as an adaptable framework for future mathematical projects.
